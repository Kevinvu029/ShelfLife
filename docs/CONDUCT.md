# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our team a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy team.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our team include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall team
* Practicing active listening and allowing all members an opportunity to contribute

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Distracted use of technology during team meetings, including unrelated phone use, texting, scrolling, or other off-task device use
* Repeated interruption, dismissive behaviour, or dominating team discussions

## 305Soft Meeting Technology Policy

All team members agree to follow the 305Soft policy of no distracted use of technology during team meetings. Phones should be put away unless they are being used directly for the meeting, note taking, scheduling, or project work. Members are expected to remain attentive and engaged throughout meetings.

## Decision Making

The team will try to make decisions through discussion and consensus whenever possible. If consensus cannot be reached in a reasonable amount of time, decisions will be made by majority vote. Important decisions about deadlines, deliverables, and project direction should be discussed with all available team members before a final decision is made.

## Attendance

Team members are expected to attend all scheduled meetings, whether in person or online. Legitimate reasons for missing a meeting include illness, family emergency, unavoidable work conflict, religious observance, or serious academic conflict.

If a member must miss a meeting, they must:
* Notify the team as early as possible
* Review meeting notes afterward
* Follow up on missed decisions and assignments
* Complete any missed work by the agreed deadline

Repeated absences without communication may be treated as a participation issue.

## Assignments

Assignments will be divided as fairly as possible based on team needs, deadlines, member strengths, and member interests. Every member is responsible for completing assigned work on time and at an acceptable level of quality.

If a member does not complete their assignment, submits poor-quality work, or fails to communicate, the team will:
* Address the issue directly and respectfully with that member
* Reassign work if necessary to protect the group deadline
* Document repeated issues in meeting notes or group communication
* Escalate the issue to the instructor if the problem continues

## Participation

All members are expected to participate actively in meetings, planning, discussions, and shared project work. The team will communicate using agreed-upon tools such as group chat, email, shared Google files, and GitHub.

To ensure full participation:
* Everyone should have a chance to speak during meetings
* Members should respond to important messages within a reasonable amount of time
* Work progress should be shared openly with the group
* Member strengths and interests should be considered when assigning work, while still distributing responsibilities fairly

## Meeting Times, Locations, and Mediums

Meeting times and locations will be chosen based on schedules that work for all team members as much as possible. The team may meet in person, online, or in a hybrid format depending on availability and project needs. Changes to meeting plans should be communicated clearly in advance.

## Agenda and Minutes / Notes

Meetings should have a clear purpose or agenda whenever possible. One team member will take notes during each meeting, and this responsibility may rotate. Notes should include attendance, decisions made, assignments, deadlines, and follow-up items. Notes will be shared through the team’s agreed communication platform or shared drive.

## Promptness

Team members are expected to arrive on time and prepared for meetings. If a member expects to be late, they should notify the team as soon as possible. Repeated lateness without communication may be addressed as a participation issue.

## Conversational Courtesies

To maintain a respectful and productive environment, the team agrees to:
* Practice active listening
* Avoid interrupting others
* Share airtime fairly
* Stay on topic or clearly identify tangents
* Disagree respectfully with ideas rather than attacking people
* Encourage quieter members to contribute
* Ask questions in a respectful and constructive way

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Team leaders and members are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, harmful, or disruptive to the team.

Team leaders have the right and responsibility to address behavior that is not aligned with this Code of Conduct and will communicate reasons for moderation or enforcement decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all team spaces, including meetings, chats, shared documents, GitHub repositories, email, and any other project-related communication. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the team in public or academic spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the team members responsible for enforcement.

**Primary contact:** [Insert Name / Email]
**Secondary contact:** [Insert Name / Email]

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All team leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Feedback

Team members should give feedback in a direct, respectful, and constructive way. Feedback should focus on work quality, communication, and behavior rather than personal criticism. Team members should also be open to receiving feedback and making improvements when concerns are raised.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Team leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Team Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the team.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from team leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested if appropriate.

### 2. Warning

**Team Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. Limited interaction with the people involved may be required for a specified period of time. Continued violations may lead to escalation to the instructor.

### 3. Temporary Removal from Team Activities

**Team Impact**: A serious violation of team standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior or failure to respect repeated warnings.

**Consequence**: Temporary removal from optional team activities or redistribution of team responsibilities, along with possible instructor involvement.

### 4. Instructor Escalation

**Team Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of team standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, refusal to contribute, or aggression toward team members.

**Consequence**: The issue will be documented and escalated to the instructor for further action.
